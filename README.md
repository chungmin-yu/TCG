Projects:  
1. Write a simple player to play Threes!.  
    * Time limit: 0.001 seconds/move  
    * Hint: use some simple heuristics to play; no search is required.  
2. Write a player to play Threes! with high winrates.  
    * Time limit: 0.01 second/move  
    * Hint: use TD learning only. No search is required.  
3. Increase the winrate of the player.  
    * Time limit: 5 seconds/move (to be modified)  
    * Hint: incorporate expectimax search into the player.
4. Write a MCTS program for the game of Hollow NoGo .  
    * Beat a weak program given by TA.  
5. Improve the above MCTS program to attend the final tournament.
